## **Overview**

The **Silver Hand** is a storied but fading guild of monster hunters, founded during the **Magicless Age** by clergy and warriors of **Selune**, the goddess of moonlight and protection. In a time when arcane defenses had vanished, and monstrous threats still roamed unchecked, the Silver Hand rose to fill the void, armed with steel, silver, and faith.

While once a **continentally respected force**, they have since declined in both numbers and influence. In the modern age, with magic returning and heroes rising, they are often regarded as **veteran aides or grim relics of a harsher past**, called upon when monsters defy spell or sword.

## **Founding & Purpose**

Founded shortly after the **Fall of Magic**, the Silver Hand was created as a bulwark against the monstrous remnants that survived the arcane collapse. With no spells or enchantments to aid them, its members relied on **faith in Selune**, martial skill, and clever tactics.

Though their origins lie in **divine service**, the guild has since diversified, **welcoming warriors, tacticians, and trackers** of all backgrounds, provided they can pass the guild’s trials.

## **Structure & Operations**

- **Guild Houses:** Each major city once hosted a chapterhouse of the Silver Hand. Today, only a handful remain fully staffed, often serving as **consultants or reserve forces** for local heroes or governments.
    
- **No Central Command:** The guild is loosely organized, united more by **tradition, shared creed, and trials** than strict hierarchy. Senior hunters, often guide younger members.
    
- **Joining the Guild:** Membership is by **invitation and trial** only. Prospective hunters undergo a **Trial of Three Nights**, where they must survive, track, and overcome threats without support or magic.

## **Monster Focus & Roles**

While the Silver Hand are **generalist hunters**, many members **specialize** in specific threats—like lycanthropy, the undead, or planar incursions

## **Views on Magic**

The Silver Hand **do not take an official stance on magic**. Unlike Guildress or the Iron Order, they **do not seek to suppress arcane power**, but many members share a **cautious or skeptical outlook**, especially toward uncontrolled magic. Divine magic, especially that of **Selune**, is revered and often seen as a guiding force.

## **Current Status**

Once legendary, the Silver Hand is now a **dwindling presence**. Where once guild caravans crossed the continent, now **only scattered cells remain**, some nearly forgotten. However, **their legacy holds weight**, and their seal still opens doors in old places.

To some, they are **myth and memory**, but when the true monsters emerge, it is often the **Silver Hand** who answers first.
