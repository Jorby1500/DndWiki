The clearing lay quiet under the arching canopy of oaks, their leaves trembling in the faint breeze that brought with it the scent of damp earth and decay. The stone in the center seemed almost to glow in the dappled sunlight, moss clinging to its base like an old coat. It was the kind of place that felt timeless, as though the world outside had shifted and changed while this patch of earth had held its breath, untouched.

Eryndil was the first to step into the clearing, his movements quiet and deliberate, like a hunter entering sacred ground. His boots sank slightly into the loam, and he paused, letting his sharp eyes trace the edges of the place he hadn’t seen in decades. “Still here,” he murmured, his voice soft against the rustle of leaves.

Caranthir followed, heavier in his step, the snap of a twig beneath his foot breaking the fragile quiet. His sword hung loosely at his side, a testament to his habit of always being prepared, even in places that posed no threat. He let out a low, sardonic laugh. “Did you think it would up and walk away?” he asked, his voice rough with age and humor.

The stone in question was unremarkable in size but not in presence. Its surface bore the marks of countless rains and the slow passage of time, its edges rounded as though the years themselves had knelt beside it, chiseling its form into something softer, something patient.

Eryndil crouched beside it, his gloved hand brushing away a scatter of damp leaves. “It feels smaller now,” he said, though his tone suggested the thought was more for himself than his companion.

“It’s not the stone that’s changed,” Caranthir replied, leaning on the haft of his sword. He gestured toward the horizon with a sweep of his hand. “It’s everything else. Look there—doesn’t that mountain seem taller to you? Sharper?”

Beyond the clearing, the forest rolled outward in waves of green and shadow, breaking at last against the foothills. From there, the land rose sharply, the jagged peak of the mountain cutting into the sky like the blade of a scythe. Its summit arched unnaturally, as though some great force had bent it toward the heavens in a moment of defiance.

Eryndil followed the gesture, his gaze lingering on the pale curve of the oxbow lake nestled in the valley below the mountain. The lake gleamed faintly, a silver mirror catching the afternoon sun, and at its bend stood a white tree, stark and skeletal against the greenery around it.

“You told me once you’d climb that mountain to find your way,” Eryndil said, his voice colored with a quiet amusement.

Caranthir grunted, stepping closer to the stone. “And you told me the lake would guide me better. You’ve always been the one with the map.”

Eryndil straightened, brushing dirt from his knees as he cast another look around the clearing. “Do you remember what you said when we met here?”

“I said I was lost.”

“No,” Eryndil replied, his grin faint but sharp. “You said you’d never been found. I told you there was a difference.”

Caranthir laughed, the sound deep and rumbling, like distant thunder. “And look where that got us.”

The shadows lengthened as the sun dipped lower in the sky, casting the clearing in hues of amber and gold. The two figures lingered a moment longer, silent now, each lost in their own memories of the place.

When they turned to leave, the forest seemed to close in behind them, the clearing returning to its timeless vigil, untouched once more.

I hadn’t thought of the clearing in years, but as soon as we stepped into it, the memories came rushing back. The same cool air carried the scent of damp moss, the same quiet stream murmured just out of sight. It was as if the place had waited, unchanged, for us to return.

I crouched beside the stone first, running my fingers over its surface. Time had smoothed its edges but couldn’t erase the grooves left by countless rains. It felt warm beneath my hand, almost alive. I turned my head toward Caranthir, who was stepping heavily through the underbrush, his sword clinking faintly against his hip.

“Still here,” I said, half to him and half to myself.

Caranthir laughed, low and rough. “I didn’t expect it to vanish.” He paused near the edge of the clearing, his broad frame casting a long shadow over the stone. “Feels different, though. Smaller.”

“No, it’s the same,” I replied, rising to my feet. I brushed the dirt from my palms, letting my eyes wander to the northern horizon. “It’s us who’ve changed.”

His gaze followed mine, settling on the mountain in the distance. It rose sharp and jagged, its peak curving over the land like the broken arch of a great hall. Beyond it, the hills rolled like the sea, cradling the oxbow lake in their embrace. Even from here, the pale white tree stood out, its twisted branches stark against the dark green of the forest.

“Do you remember?” I asked. “When we met here?”

Caranthir snorted. “I said I was lost.”

I shook my head, a small smile tugging at my lips. “You said you’d climb that mountain to find your way. I told you the lake would guide you better.”

“And you were right, as usual,” he said, though there was a heaviness to his voice now, one that hadn’t been there before. “But one of these days, I’ll leave the path, and you’ll be the one searching.”

“If that day comes,” I said quietly, “I’ll follow you here. Some things are worth finding, Caranthir, no matter how hard the journey.”

The shadows were lengthening by the time we left the clearing, the forest dimming around us. I glanced back as we passed into the trees, my eyes lingering on the stone, the mountain, and the lake. I told myself we’d return again someday—together, if fate allowed.
