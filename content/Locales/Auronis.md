## About

Auronis is a city of rapid magical evolution, where ambition drives innovation—but not without cost. Of the three sister cities, it has prospered most since the return of magic, though this resurgence has drawn it ever closer to powers beyond mortal understanding. Built atop ancient ruins and forgotten lore, Auronis is a place where the boundaries between law and lawlessness, and between contemporary arcane study and something far more ancient, are dangerously thin. Rune-lit neon streets flicker above throngs of mages, artificers, and seekers chasing their next arcane breakthrough, while hidden laboratories and secretive guilds operate in the shadows—some in pursuit of knowledge, others of forbidden power. A thriving black market fuels the city's darker pulse, trading in stolen research, illegal magitech, and artifacts best left untouched. Amid the glow of soaring towers and the ceaseless hum of magical machinery, shadows shift—and in Auronis, not all secrets remain buried
