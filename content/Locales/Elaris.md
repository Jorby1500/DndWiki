## About
Elaris, one of the three sister cities, is dedicated to the goddess of the dawn. A city of old and new, it is the birthplace of magic’s return—a place forever marked by the spell that reshaped the world a century ago. The powerful ritual cast by  left physical and metaphysical scars upon the city, warping its skies, its people, and its foundations. Though ancient, its streets weave between structures both timeworn and newly rebuilt, a direct result of the devastation caused by the resurgence of magic. The people of Elaris remain deeply wary of arcane power, placing their trust instead in divine magic and advancing technology to maintain stability.

Despite this, magic is ever-present, lingering in its very air. The city’s towering **Dawnspire** holds an ancient artifact—the **Sunstone Core**, a device of unknown origin said to protect the city in its greatest times of need. Some believe it is powered by the bound soul of a Titan of Creation, while others see it as merely a grand relic of the past. Regardless, its energy flickers anew, stirring ancient fears.

Among its people, the **Spell-Scarred** are a rarity—individuals whose very bodies were changed by Malric’s spell, manifesting unpredictable and often supernatural effects. While some revere them as touched by divinity, others fear them as cursed remnants of magic’s destructive return.

Elaris is a city of contrasts: reverent yet afraid, ancient yet ever-changing, caught between its past and an uncertain future.
