## About

Guildress is a city of imposing beauty and rigid control, where every structure, citizen, and rule exists to suppress arcane chaos. Its wide, immaculate streets and seamless white stone architecture—veined with golden zandridite—reflect a relentless commitment to order. Colossal, regimented towers rise above the city, each adorned with banners bearing the symbol of the Bastion: a constant reminder of strength, purity, and dominion.

At the city's heart stands the **Auric Keep**, a fortified citadel from which the [[Exarch, Tobias Veyne]] governs. From this central hub, the city radiates outward in geometric precision—ensuring surveillance, efficiency, and containment. The skyline is broken only by the grim presence of the **Black Crucible**, a brutalist monument to Guildress' war on magic. The birthplace of the [[Editcts]], experimental and brainwashed mage hunters used to hunt rogue and [[aberrant mages]]

Founded in the wake of magic’s return, Guildress was born from necessity—a military outpost forged into a city-state. Built atop rich veins of zandridite, a rare anti-magic mineral, it has grown into the world’s most fortified sanctuary against arcane threats. Here, magic is neither practiced nor tolerated, save for tightly controlled divine rites. Arcane spellcasters are hunted, judged, and either purged or broken.

While the city thrives in stability, it does so at a cost. Golden lanterns flicker in place of spell-light, citizens march in perfect order, and every action is watched.
