**One of the three sister cities: [[Elaris]], [[Valoris]], and [[Auronis]] — named after the daughters of [[Pelor]] and [[Selune]]. They represent Dawn, Midday, and Twilight.**

Valoris radiates grandeur. Expansive plazas, sun-dappled streets, and cathedral-like structures adorned with golden sun motifs define its splendor. At the city’s heart lies Solspire Plaza, a vast circular square where the monumental Grand Heliohall built from pale stone and shimmering glass houses the Coalition Council

The city's architecture features towering spires, domes, rooftop gardens, and sun-dial towers, all reflecting its deep solar theme. Streets spiral outward from the central plaza in a radiant pattern visible from the sky. Brightly colored banners, intricate mosaics of solar cycles, and bridges connecting lofty buildings contribute to Valoris’ breathtaking skyline.

Cultural diversity thrives in its many vibrant neighborhoods, each celebrating unique festivals rich with music, dance, and cuisine. Yet beneath the city's luminous surface, ancient catacombs hide secrets. Whispers speak of a divine artifact buried in the city's depths—an object said to be tied to Valoris herself.

## About

Valoris, the luminous heart of the continent, was founded during the age of high magic. It is named after Valoris, daughter of [[Pelor]] and [[Selune]], embodying the unwavering brilliance of the midday sun. Built around the central _Solspire Plaza_, the city rose as a beacon of unity, where diverse peoples gathered under divine protection.

During the cataclysmic war against the gods, Valoris endured, witnessing both the zenith of magic and the sorrow of its disappearance. In the centuries without magic, Valoris evolved into a powerful center of politics and culture. It became home to one of the continent’s oldest magical academies—now a theoretical and conservative institution during magic’s absence.

With magic returning to the world, Valoris stands at a crossroads. Some seek to reclaim the arcane glory of the past, while others fear the consequences of its resurgence. The ever-present Council, which governs from the _Grand Heliohall_, faces rising tension between pro- and anti-magic factions.
